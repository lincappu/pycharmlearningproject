In the house where I grew up， it was our custom to leave the front door on the latch at night。 I don't know if that was a local term or if it is universal; "on the latch" meant the door was closed but not locked。 None of us carried keys; the last one in for the evening would close up， and that was it
Those days are over。 In rural areas as well as in cities， doors do not stay unlocked， even for part of an evening
Suburbs and country areas are， in many ways， even more vulnerable than well-patroled urban streets。 Statistics show the crime rate rising more dramatically in those allegedly tranquil areas than in cities。 At any rate， the era of leaving the front door on the latch is over
It has been replaced by dead-bolt locks， security chains， electronic alarm systems and trip wires hooked up to a police station or private guard firm。 Many suburban families have sliding glass doors on their patios， with steel bars elegantly built in so no one can pry the doors open
